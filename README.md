## What is it

Technical Debt Dataset is a curated dataset containing measurement data from four tools executed on all commits to enable researchers to work on a common set of data and thus compare their results.

The dataset was built by extracting the projects' data and analyzing all the commit using several tools. To get the data, the projects' GitHub repositories were cloned, commit information was collected from the git log using [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller), refactorings were classified using [Refactoring Miner](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner), and issue information was obtained by extracting issues from the Jira issue tracker. After that, code quality was inspected using two tools: Technical Debt items were analyzed with [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), and code smells [2] and anti-patterns [3] with [Ptidej](http://www.ptidej.net/). In addition, the fault-inducing and -fixing commits were identified by applying [our implementation](https://github.com/clowee/OpenSZZ) of the SZZ algorithm [4].

 

## How to use it
The dataset is  provided as an SQLite database with a  .db extension. The file  can be opened with a SQLite browser such as SQLiteStudio. After opening, the data can be queried using SQL by selecting "Tools" and "Open SQL Editor". Data
can also be exported as a CSV file by selecting "Tools" and "Export" and then exporting a whole table or an SQL query.

SQL enables to easily query the data from the dataset. 

Here are two simple examples: 


**Get the number of "Bug" and "Vulnerability" SonarQube issues in all the branches of a project.**

```sql
SELECT  SONAR_ISSUES.projectID,  count(SONAR_ISSUES.projectID)  AS  numberOfBugIssues,  numberOfVulnerabilityIssues
FROM SONAR_ISSUES
JOIN
(SELECT  SONAR_ISSUES.projectID,  count(SONAR_ISSUES.projectID)  AS  numberOfVulnerabilityIssues
FROM SONAR_ISSUES
WHERE  TYPE='VULNERABILITY'
GROUP BY SONAR_ISSUES.projectID) AS V ON SONAR_ISSUES.projectID = V.projectID
WHERE TYPE='BUG'
GROUP BY SONAR_ISSUES.projectID
```




**Get the commit message and author of all the commits fixing a SonarQube issue in any branch.**

```sql
SELECT  GIT_COMMITS.commitMessage,  GIT_COMMITS.author
FROM	SZZ_FAULT_INDUCING_COMMITS
JOIN  GIT_COMMITS
ON SZZ_FAULT_INDUCING_COMMITS.faultFixingCommitHash = GIT_COMMITS.commitHash
```

It is important to note that the dataset has been created analyzing all the commits of each project, **without considering branches**. Moreover, the **Technical Debt items were exported as reported by the tools. We did not excluded duplications nor filtered any technical debt issues**, since we aimed at providing to the community exactly what is proided by the tools.  
If you are interested to filter issues, considering only unique Technical Debt Items, filter commits in the branch you are interested to analyze (Table GIT_COMMITS, Attrigute 'branches'). Considering all the commits, would result in duplicated items.

## How to contribute

**Submit New Projects**
If you have analyzed a project with SonarQube and you are interested to share your data in our dataset, please send us an email ( davide [dot] taibi [ at ] tuni [ dot ] fi )

To integrate your analysis please, report the following information 
* sonarqube_version
* project_name
* development_language
* github_url
* analyzed branch
* jira url 

We will run the SZZ tool and refactoring miner 1.0.0 on your repository and integrate your data in a new release of the dataset. 

**Automate the analysis pipeline**
We are also looking for contributors to automate the analysis pipeline. If you are interested to contribute, send us a message. 

**Submit Issues and correct errors**
